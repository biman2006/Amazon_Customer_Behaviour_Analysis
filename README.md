#  📊 Amazon_Customer_Behaviour_Analysis
In this project I analyse Amazon Customer Behaviour

 
 ## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes an Amazon sales dataset to understand sales trends, revenue distribution, payment usage, seller performance, and order cancellation behavior.
The main goal is to find simple business insights using Python data analysis.

## 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains details such as:

Product name and category

Seller information

Country

Payment method

Shipping cost

Discount

Order status (Cancelled / Not Cancelled)

Revenue and quantity sold

## 🎯 Questions Answered in This Project

Top 5 most sold products with their categories

Most used payment method

Top 5 countries generating the highest revenue

Does shipping cost affect order cancellation?

Which seller generates the highest revenue?

Top 5 sellers with the highest cancellation rate

Which product category has the highest cancellation rate?

Does low discount lead to higher cancellation?

## 📈 Key Findings (Simple Words)

A few products and categories contribute to most of the sales

Customers prefer one payment method more than others

Revenue mainly comes from a small number of countries

Higher shipping cost does NOT mean higher cancellation

Orders with low shipping cost actually show higher cancellation rates

The seller with the highest revenue is not always the most reliable

Some sellers cancel orders more frequently than others

Certain product categories have higher cancellation rates

Orders with very low or no discount tend to get cancelled more

## 🧠 What This Means

Cancellation is influenced more by seller behavior, product category, and customer intent

Shipping cost alone is not a strong reason for cancellation

Discounts play an important role in order completion

## 🛠 Tools Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Project Type

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Business Insight Analysis

## 🚀 Conclusion

This project shows how simple data analysis can help understand customer behavior and cancellation patterns.
The insights can help improve pricing strategy, seller performance, and customer experience.
